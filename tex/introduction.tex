In lisp-like languages, there are usually two phases: first we execute macros,
then we execute code. With compiled lisp-like languages, macro evaluation is
usually done during compilation. This creates problems - for example, using
`runtime' code inside macros is usually not straight-forward.  I wish to
implement a small lisp-like language to see if these two stages can be merged
by having macros be simply functions with slightly different semantics -
essentially, performed during runtime, from the perspective of the programmer.

The examples in this section will have a `lispy' pseudocode notation.

\subsection{Partial evaluation}

In this context, we regard \emph{partial evaluation} to be ...

\begin{lstwrap}\begin{lstlisting}
(here is some code)
\end{lstlisting}\end{lstwrap}

\begin{mexample}
    this shall be an example
    \begin{lstwrap}\begin{lstlisting}
    (here is some code inside the example)
    \end{lstlisting}\end{lstwrap}
\end{mexample}
